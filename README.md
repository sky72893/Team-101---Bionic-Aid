EGR 314 - Team 101 Project Repository

Team project is a prototype of an exoskeletal hand that allows the user to have a robotically sealed grip that is controlled by wires embedded in the hand. These wires are reeled in when the pressure sensor is pressurized for 5 seconds, allowing the user to grip the object with control until the release of the hand after pressurizing the sensor for 10 seconds.
This prototype has a web shooter included that will shoot web strings when changing the orientation of a gyro, the web shooter will later be designed to help grab and reel in distanced objects after the creation of the original prototype.
